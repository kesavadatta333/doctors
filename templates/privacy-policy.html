				<h6 style="color: navy">COOKIES</h6>
				<p style="color: navy; font-weight: lighter">
					To improve the responsiveness of the sites for our users, we may use “cookies”, or similar

					Identification (User ID) to understand the user’s individual interests using the Identified
					Computer. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), we will have
					no way of knowing who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal
					information a cookie can contain is information you supply (an example of this is when you ask for
					our Personalised Horoscope). A cookie cannot read data off your hard drive. Our advertisers may also
					assign their own cookies to your browser (if you click on their ads), a process that we do not
					control.</br>
				</p>
				<p style="color: navy; font-weight: lighter">
					Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer’s connection to the

					computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data — such as the web pages you view.)
					Your IP address does not identify you personally. We use this information to deliver our web pages
					to you upon request, to tailor our site to the interests of our users, to measure traffic within our
					site and let advertisers know the geographic locations from where our visitors come.
